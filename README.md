Small diary- 31/12/17
So far in this project I've struggled with transforming my ideas into my code
which has been quite annoying as I have a good idea of what I want to create
however lacking the knowledge of the right code is slightly frustrating.
On the other hand solving the issues I come across definitely helped to
improve my own understanding of the code I'm working with. Over the next few
days I'll need to add adjust the gameplay to portray a radical change and play
around with adding new content to the code.

Began working on the power up mechanic, started by creating a basic placeholder
asset in order to develop the code first.

Still stuck on adding physics to powerup, the player can phase through it instead
of colliding. I modified the bullet velocity in order to make the gameplay feel
more engaging and responsive.
